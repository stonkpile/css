# css
This is our CSS framework

My goal is to minimize technical debt, to increase productivity and to keep a consistent style across our projects.

This is just like bootstrap and similar frameworks. In fact, we share a lot of code since I've cherrypicked most of it from the major players :-)

I have identified a couple of components that we use quite regularly but they are not within a official framework, yet.

My proposal is that we create "our own" CSS framework, tailored for our needs. (basically cherrypicking the good stuff in to our own repo)

We start by trying to make the old codebase look a bit more modern, using this framework.

Then I want to build a UI-kit using this CSS so that our newer features can be built using modern tech. and keep a consistent style with the old codebase (that now looks a bit better for the end-user)

We'll still have tons of JS technical debt until
